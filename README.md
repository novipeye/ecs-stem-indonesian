ECS-STEM-Indonesian

**ECS-STEM-Indonesian** is a Laravel-based web application implementing the Enhanced Confix Stripping algorithm for Indonesian word stemming. This tool extracts the root form of Indonesian words, improving natural language processing tasks like text analysis, search, and classification.

### Key Features:
- Accurate root word extraction using Enhanced Confix Stripping algorithm
- Simple and intuitive web interface built with Laravel and Blade templates
- Easily extendable for other Indonesian NLP tasks
- Lightweight and fast, suitable for educational or prototype purposes

### Why ECS-STEM-Indonesian?
Indonesian language stemming is challenging due to rich affixes and morphological variations. This project demonstrates a practical approach to handling these complexities, making it useful for developers, researchers, and students interested in NLP and Bahasa Indonesia text processing.

### Project Status

This project is still a work in progress. While the current implementation uses the Enhanced Confix Stripping (CS) algorithm to stem Indonesian words, there are still some linguistic patterns that are not yet fully covered â€” such as infixes, reduplicated (repetitive) words, and other complex morphological forms.

I plan to integrate additional stemming algorithms in the future to improve accuracy and make the stemmer more robust for real-world applications.
